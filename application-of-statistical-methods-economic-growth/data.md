# Data

This marks the start to the advanced section. Please note that if you are a participant graded as an advanced student, you need to complete this entire section to recieve your advance certificate. However, if you are a beginner and have time and motivation left, feel free to complete this section too!

In the following section we would like to model what effect economic growth. We will use different models and approaches regarding the growth of real GDP. Please be mindful that with anything we may find, we cannot really establish any causuality without further theoretical considerations or more statistically sound methodology beyond the scope if this term's project. However, our data at hand is still a great set to practice the idea behind modelling and machine learning.

\
We have previously worked with just the  [ports](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg5gVAG0Yz7-GaV5wtg?e=ySaVSM) and [geographical location](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg5gUs1Suv51j\_Wx\_9g?e=9D5Rry) data sets. Keep the prepared data from the beginner part for later! We will use it later to enrich our models.\
We now will have a look at some [UN data](https://data.un.org/). Thus, please be mindful of properly citing sources, and refer back to the [Sources Section](../the-data-science-project/sources.md) if you are unsure.

Please [klick here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg5gTNPDOOZH9P8wuRQ?e=xkB2dW) to download the data we have prepared for you. Load this data and familiarize yourself with the variables and the concepts. Leave some remarks regarding what data you find and any issues you may come across! Remedy the latter, we especially recommend you to rename some variables.

Just for your information: you are looking at cross-sectional data for the year 2021.

To sum up your tasks:&#x20;

* [ ] Load the UN\_data set
* [ ] Familiarize yourself with the data, do you understand everything?
* [ ] Are there any issues with the variables?
* [ ] Remedy any issues&#x20;
* [ ] Comment your code
