# Merging Data

This marks the start to the advanced section. Please note that if you are a participant graded as an advanced student, you need to complete this entire section to recieve your advance certificate. However, if you are a beginner and have time and motivation left, feel free to complete this section too!

\
We have previously worked with just the  [ports](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg5gVAG0Yz7-GaV5wtg?e=ySaVSM) and [geographical location](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg5gUs1Suv51j\_Wx\_9g?e=9D5Rry) data sets. Keep the prepared data from the beginner part!\
We now want to enrich our data with some more variables with [UN data](https://data.un.org/). Thus, please be mindful of properly citing sources, and refer back to the [Sources Section](../the-data-science-project/sources.md) if you are unsure.

Please [klick here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ais4tuRZBkegg6IHxc3xX\_Ui2T6GFw?e=bVV6vD) to download the data we have prepared for you, and merge it to your already prepared data set. Again, tell us your thought process and comment your code!

Just for your information: after merging you will be looking at cross-sectional data for the year 2021.
