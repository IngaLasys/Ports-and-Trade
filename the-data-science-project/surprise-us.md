# Surprise Us!

If you are a beginner, you are almost done with the semester project!\
Until now we have done our best to hold you by your hand and be your companion through this project. Now it is your turn: surprise us with a graph you have come up with yourself! \
Take any of the variables in our data set, make some computations explaining to us why and what you can understand from these, and give us a graph at the end. As an example, you could focus on a country of your choice, or have a look at a specific industry. Let your creativity flow!



Deadline is: ????
