# The Project Guide

Welcome to the project guide part for your TechAcademy data science project! This guide will lead you through the different steps of your project and will provide you with useful hints along the way.

Please read this document carefully, as we will ask you to complete the tasks in a specific way to make sure what you learn with us this term will be helpful for your future projects too. Completing exercises in the way you are asked to do is also important in oder to receive your certificate, since completion of all coding tasks alone is not the way to go.\
Furthermore, since we are working with data from public institutions, we want to be sure to cite sources correctly!\
