# Cleaning Ports Variables

Before we can start with EDA, we need to clean our data. As you may have noticed, some variables are character variables despite them needing to be numeric. Start by looking at the "ports" data set. As you can see, there are two variables meant to show shares, however, these are not of numeric type. Transform both share variables into numeric. Let us know what changes you needed to make, and extensively comment your code.
