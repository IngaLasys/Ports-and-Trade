# Setting up your Programming Environment

Without the necessary tools, you cannot start any project. With your hands alone, you will not be able to analyze data (or at least we do not recommend!). If you have not set up your environment, follows the steps below for your respective language.

> We work with R and RStudio locally which requires a setup. If you have not installed it yet here is a [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu). \
> In case you want some more information, you can also refer to this [written guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) by RStudio itself.
>
> If you struggle, we will help you with installing at the “Introduction to Coding” Workshop or at our first Coding Meetup.
>
>
>
> For the ones who already have installed R and RStudio before, please update both your R and RStudio versions, as well as packages. \
> To update RStudio, download and install the latest version from the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)
>
> &#x20;To run R and package updates all in one, run the below code in R Gui (not in RStudio console!):
>
> ```r
> install.packages("installr")
> library(installr)
> updateR() 
> ```

> We recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for this project since it requires no particular setup, stores its notebooks to your Google Drive, and makes it easy for you to share them with your team members.
>
> As an alternative to Google Colab, you might want to install Jupyter Notebook locally using the Anaconda distribution. We will give you a more detailed step-by-step demo during the “Introduction to Coding Workshop” or our first Coding Meetup.
