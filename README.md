# Welcome!

Let’s begin with the basics! In both the R and the Python track, you will work on your project in small groups with your peers. Not only will be able to help eachother and perhaps get the project done faster, but we also want you to compare your results and discuss your findings – remember, coding is just half the effort, understanding what the data and the output shows is even more important! \
Our experience shows: The different backgrounds of the members and discussing different opinions and ideas will produce the best results.&#x20;

Your group should consist of approximately four team members. You can choose your teammates independently; we will not interfere with your arrangements. However, we can assist you to find your team members. \
It is important that all group members complete the same level of difficulty (beginner or advanced), since the tasks are different in scope for each level. We explicitly encourage you to collaborate with students from different university faculties and education levels. This not only allows you to get to know people from other faculties, but may also give you a whole new perspective on the project and tasks. When submitting your project please note: for a certificate, each person must submit the project individually. \
Furthermore, we expect every teammember to explain their code and properly document their work. However, hand-ins may be similar within your group, however not carbon copies. You can get more information at our first Coding Meetup on **DATE????.** For more detailed information please keep on reading, the side bar should guide you to the relevant sections.

Every semester, the Product Development Team at TechAcademy thinks hard about a new project that is suited for you to learn data science. While for some semesters we deal with personal data, such as past Netflix and Spotify projects. In others, we have more natural sciences related projects taking on the topic of Covid-19,  or Honey & Bees. Or we turn more into business related topics by exploring AirBnb data, or bike sharing. Data science is best learned by doing it - no matter what data, we all have to start somewhere.&#x20;

This semester we decided to analyse in important part of our economy and lives: ports and trade. In the past few years we got to experience - and still experience - the effect of trade disruptions. Since trade via searoute is the most important path of trade, we found it interesting to have a close look at port data. Though none of us are experts in trade and ports, we still believe that together we can learn a lot from this case study, while climbing the learning curve of coding and data science.&#x20;
