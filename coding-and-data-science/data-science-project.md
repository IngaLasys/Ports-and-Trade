# Data Science Project

TODO: Add section headers

Now that you have gained a theoretical glimpse into Data Science from the DataCamp courses, you can put your skills into practice with our term project! Don't worry if you have not completed all the courses before the project start, you can also complete some more advanced courses while working on the project.

Let’s begin with the basics! In both the R and the Python track, you will work on your project individually but are encouraged to collaborate and exchange ideas with your peers. Not only will you be able to help each other, but we also want you to compare your results and discuss your findings – remember, coding is just half the effort, understanding what the data and the output shows is even more important! \
Our experience shows: The different backgrounds of the class members and discussing opinions and ideas will produce the best results.&#x20;

Try to exchange ideas and experiences with people from the Advanced track (if you are in the Beginner track) and vice versa. Furthermore, we encourage you to collaborate with students from different university faculties and education levels. This not only allows you to get to know people from other faculties, but may also give you a whole new perspective on the project and tasks.&#x20;

Every semester, the Product Development Team at TechAcademy thinks hard about a new project that is suited for you to learn data science. While for some semesters we deal with personal data, such as past Netflix and Spotify projects. In others, we have more natural sciences related projects taking on the topic of Covid-19,  or Honey & Bees. Or we turn more into business related topics by exploring AirBnb data, or bike sharing. Data science is best learned by doing it - no matter what data, we all have to start somewhere.&#x20;

This semester we decided to analyse an important part of our economy and lives: ports and trade. In the past few years we got to experience - and still experience - the effect of trade disruptions. Since trade via searoute is the most important path of trade, we found it interesting to have a close look at port data. Though none of us are experts in trade and ports, we still believe that together we can learn a lot from this case study, while climbing the learning curve of coding and data science.&#x20;

If you still feel a little unsure about how to start, we have got you covered! In our first meeting, the **Coding Introduction** on **DATE**, we will give you a general sense on how to start off with `Python` or `R`. Furthermore, we will tell you what we would like for you to keep in mind when completing the project, especially with regards to the documentation of your code.

In the **Coding Meetups (CM)** we will first provide you with presentations about the topic of the respective CM and answer your questions. In the second part you can continue with your project and ask the mentors in case you encounter challenges.

After our second meeting, your work on the semester project will begin. You will find the project tasks, including further explanations and hints in the following chapters of this page.

As we have probably already told you, with completion of the project as well as the DataCamp courses you can earn a TechAcademy certificate. To achieve this, you must:

* at least solve two-thirds of the “Exploratory Data Analysis” section of your Data Science project if you are a beginner, including proper documentation of your code.
* **ADVANCED????**

In addition, we expect you to at least complete two-thirds (6/9 courses) of the respective curriculum on DataCamp. For more detailed information about the curriculum, have a look in the “Curriculum” section of your track languages above.
