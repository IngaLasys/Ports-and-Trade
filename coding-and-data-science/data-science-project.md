# Data Science Project

Now that you have gained a theoretical glimpse into Data Science from the DataCamp courses, you can put your skills into practice with our term project! Don't worry if you have not completed all the courses before the project start, you can also complete some more advanced courses while working on the project.

The project we have put together for you uses real world port and trade data. You can read more about the details of this project in the following chapters of this project guide.

If you still feel a little unsure about how to start, we have got you covered! In our first meeting, the **Coding Introduction** on **DATE**, we will give you a general sense on how to start off with `Python` or `R`. Furthermore, we will tell you what we would like for you to keep in mind when completing the project, especially in sense of documentation and commenting of code.

In our second meeting, the first **Coding Meetup** on **DATE**, we will describe the project. WFurthermore, we will tell you what we would like for you to keep in mind when completing the project, especially in sense of documentation and commenting of code.

After our second meeting, your work on the semester project will begin. You will find the project tasks, including further explanations and hints in the following chapters of this page.

As we have probably already told you, with completion of the project as well as the DataCamp courses you can earn a TechAcademy certificate. To achieve this, you must:

* at least solve two-thirds of the “Exploratory Data Analysis” section of your Data Science project if you are a beginner, including proper documentation of your code.
* **ADVANCED????**

In addition, we expect you to at least complete two-thirds (6/9 courses) of the respective curriculum on DataCamp. For more detailed information about the curriculum, have a look in the “Curriculum” section of your track languages above.

#### Coding Meetups

To give you an overview of our Meetups, you can find all the dates here!

* **DATE**, EVENT

#### Deadline

You need to complete the project, fully documented and formatted, as well as complete the DataCamp courses until **DATE 23:59:59**
