# R & DataCamp?

**Setting Up your Programming Environment**

Before you can use `R`, you usually have to install some separate programs locally on your computer. Typically, you first install a ["raw" version](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) of `R`. In theory, you can then start programming, but we would not recommend you to use R just like that. It is challenging to carry out an entire project with a "raw" version of R. That's why there is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`, and it is much easier to use and nicer to look at!

If you have not set up your environment, follows the steps below for your respective language.

> We work with R and RStudio locally which requires a setup. If you have not installed it yet here is a [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu). \
> In case you want some more information, you can also refer to this [written guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) by RStudio itself.
>
> If you struggle, we will help you with installing at the “Introduction to Coding” Workshop or at our first Coding Meetup. But do not hesitate to contact your mentor or the Product Development team any time.

> For the ones who already have installed R and RStudio before, please update both your R and RStudio versions, as well as packages. \
> To update RStudio, download and install the latest version from the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)
>
> &#x20;To run R and package updates all in one, run the below code in R Gui (not in RStudio console!):
>
> ```r
> install.packages("installr")
> library(installr)
> updateR() 
> ```



But for now you should focus on learning the "hard skills" of programming with the courses on DataCamp.&#x20;

#### DataCamp Courses and Curriculum

The following list shows the required DataCamp courses for the Data Science with `R` Track at TechAcademy. As a beginner, please stick to the courses of the "beginner" program. Ambitious beginners can, of course, take the advanced courses afterwards. However, it would be best if you worked through the courses in the order we listed them.

The same applies to the advanced courses. Here, too, you should finish the specified courses in the given order. Since it can, of course, happen that you have already mastered the topics of an advanced course, you can replace some courses. If you are convinced that the course does not add value to you, feel free to replace it with one of the courses in the "Exchange Pool" (see list below). However, you should not pursue an exchange course until you finish all chapters from the advanced course: "Intermediate R." We provide you with a recommended timeline in the Agenda.

To receive the certificate, both beginners and advanced learners must complete at least two-thirds of the curriculum (6/9 courses). For the beginners, this means until -- and including -- the course [Cleaning Data in R (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) and for the advanced until --and including -- [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse (4h)](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse). In addition, you should complete at least _two-thirds_ of the project tasks. After completing the curriculum and the project's (minimal) requirements, you will receive your TechAcademy certificate!
