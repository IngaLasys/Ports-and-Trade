# R & DataCamp?

### Data Science and R?

`R` is a programming language developed by statisticians in the early 90s to calculate and visualize statistical results. A lot has happened since then, and by now, `R` is one of the most widely used programming languages in Data Science. You don't have to compile your 'R' code, but you can use it interactively and dynamically. Such an approach makes it possible to quickly gain basic knowledge about existing data and display it graphically.

`R` offers much more than just programming. The language provides a complete ecosystem for solving statistical problems. A large number of packages and interfaces are available, which you can use to expand the basic functionality of the programming language to, say, create an interactive map of boats crossing oceans or cruising down rivers.

#### RStudio Cloud

Before you can use `R`, you usually have to install some separate programs locally on your computer. Typically, you first install a ["raw" version](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) of `R`. In theory, you can then start programming, but we would not recommend you to use R just like that. It is challenging to carry out an entire project with a "raw" version of R. That's why there is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`, and it is much easier to use and nicer to look at!

The IDE includes many essential features that simplify programming with `R`. Among other things, an auto-completion of your code, a friendly user interface, and many expansion options. Think of R as your boats's engine. And think of RStudio as your boats's dashboard that shows fancy metrics, has a radio and allows you to navigate stormy seas!

Experience has shown that installing `R` and RStudio locally on your computer takes some effort and troubleshooting. Thus, try to download R as well as RStudio right before the first coding meetup! If you have any issues, do not hesitate to contact the product development team.

But for now you should focus on learning the "hard skills" of programming with the courses on DataCamp. That brings us to your curriculum in the next section!

#### DataCamp Courses and Curriculum

The following list shows the required DataCamp courses for the Data Science with `R` Track at TechAcademy. As a beginner, please stick to the courses of the "beginner" program. Ambitious beginners can, of course, take the advanced courses afterwards. However, it would be best if you worked through the courses in the order we listed them.

The same applies to the advanced courses. Here, too, you should finish the specified courses in the given order. Since it can, of course, happen that you have already mastered the topics of an advanced course, you can replace some courses. If you are convinced that the course does not add value to you, feel free to replace it with one of the courses in the "Exchange Pool" (see list below). However, you should not pursue an exchange course until you finish all chapters from the advanced course: "Intermediate R." We provide you with a recommended timeline in the Agenda.

To receive the certificate, both beginners and advanced learners must complete at least two-thirds of the curriculum (6/9 courses). For the beginners, this means until -- and including -- the course [Cleaning Data in R (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) and for the advanced until --and including -- [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse (4h)](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse). In addition, you should complete at least _two-thirds_ of the project tasks. After completing the curriculum and the project's (minimal) requirements, you will receive your TechAcademy certificate!
