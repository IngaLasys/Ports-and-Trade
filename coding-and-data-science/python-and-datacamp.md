# Python & DataCamp

`Python` is a dynamic programming language. You can execute the code in the interpreter, so you do not have to compile the code first. This feature makes `Python` very easy and quick to use. The excellent usability, easy readability, and simple structuring were and still are core ideas in developing this programming language.

You can use `Python` to program according to any paradigm, whereby structured and object-oriented programming is most straightforward due to the structure of the language. Still, functional or aspect-oriented programming is also possible.&#x20;

#### Setting up the Computer

We are working with the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic\_features\_overview.ipynb) platform that contains a Jupyter environment with the necessary libraries in the cloud. You therefore do not need to install anything locally. You can import all the data required for the project with Google Drive. We will introduce this environment during our first Coding Meetup.&#x20;

If you want to use `Python`locally you must install it on the computer. `Python` is already installed on Linux and Unix systems (such as macOS), but often it is an older version. Since there are differences in the handling of `Python` version 2 -- which is no longer supported -- and version 3, we decided to work with version 3.6 or higher.

One of the easiest ways to get Python and most of the best-known programming libraries is to install Anaconda. There are detailed explanations for installing all operating systems on the [website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) of the provider.

With Anaconda installed, all you have to do is open the Anaconda Navigator, and you're ready to go. There are two ways to get started: Spyder or Jupyter. Spyder is the integrated development environment (IDE) for `Python` and offers all possibilities from syntax highlighting to debugging (links to tutorials below).

The other option is to use Jupyter or Jupyter notebooks. It is an internet technology-based interface for executing commands. The significant advantage of this is that you can quickly write shortcode pieces and try them out interactively without writing an entire executable program. Now you can get started!

If you have not worked with Jupyter before, we recommend that you complete [this DataCamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/introduction-to-projects/guided/Python) first. There you will get to know many tips and tricks that will make your workflow with Jupyter much easier.

#### DataCamp courses and Curriculum

The following list shows the required DataCamp courses for the Data Science with `Python` Track at TechAcademy. As a beginner, please stick to the courses of the "beginner" program. Ambitious beginners can, of course, take the advanced courses afterward. However, it would be best if you worked through the courses in the order we listed them.

The same applies to the advanced courses. Here, too, you should finish the specified courses in the given order. Since it can, of course, happen that you have already mastered the topics of an advanced course, you can replace some courses. If you are convinced that the course does not add value to you, feel free to replace it with one of the courses in the "Exchange Pool" (see list below). However, you should not pursue an exchange course until you finish all chapters from the advanced course: "Intermediate Python." We provide you with a recommended timeline in the Agenda.

To receive the certificate, both beginners and advanced learners must complete at least two-thirds of the curriculum (6/9 courses). For the beginners, this means until -- and including -- the course "[Joining Data with pandas (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-pandas)" and for the advanced until --and including -- "[Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-linear-modeling-in-python)." In addition, you should complete at least _two-thirds_ of the project tasks. After completing the curriculum and the project's (minimal) requirements, you will receive your TechAcademy certificate!
